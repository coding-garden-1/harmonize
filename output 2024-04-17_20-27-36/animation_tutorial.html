    <h2>Animated Video Tutorial</h2>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This tutorial is only relevant if you wish to animate your videos, which is a completely optional step and may require additional time and resources. Feel free to close this page if it doesn't apply to you.</p>

    <h3>Setup Process</h3>
    <p>Before proceeding, perform the following setup steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the play button next to "Setup".</li>
        <li>Wait for the green checkmark to appear next to the setup button.</li>
        <li>After a few minutes, scroll through the output text, locate the "Restart Session" option, and click it.</li>
        <li>Then, click the "Setup" button again.</li>
    </ol>

    <br/>

    <h3>Getting a Hugging Face Token</h3>
    <p>Once the setup process is complete, sign up or log in to Hugging Face <a href="https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens" target="_blank">here</a>. Once logged in, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the play button next to "Log into Hugging Face".</li>
        <li>Enter your token into the input field and press Enter.</li>
        <li>Click the play button next to "Google Colab Hack" and wait until you see the green checkmark next to the button.</li>
        <li>Click the play button next to "Download Weights" and wait until you see the green checkmark next to the button.</li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload your image by dragging it into the space or by clicking the manila folder icon at the left and navigating to the appropriate folder (e.g., Image One, Image Two, etc.).
                <li>Click the first button for the sampling function.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the second button for the sampling function and wait until it reaches about ninety-seven percent.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the last two steps for each image: Upload image from the appropriate folder and click the second button for the sampling function.</li>
    </ol>

    <br/>

    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>If you encounter any errors with the second sampling function, restarting the entire video creation process should resolve the issue. Alternatively, you can use the slideshow feature instead of animations.</p>
    <p>All the videos will remain in your default downloads folder. Once all the entities are done at ninety-seven percent completion, write "completed" in the command prompt.</p>
