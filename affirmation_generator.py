you are always experiencing success with pain pong’ note that ping pong is a metaphor here is a a mindset about the topic itself rather than the details: I want you to write thirty six affirmations about the topic itself: sevenaffirmations that support success in the area of life being a normal experience for the individual in their identity (successfully winning in ping pong is a normal experience for me; I am someone who naturally succeeds at ping pong; everything within me naturally draws me to the right decisions to succeed in ping kong; I never have to worry about winning ping pong because it’s natural for me;

I’m completely empowered whether ping pong is here for me or not; I’m completely protected and I don’t need pig pod; I am always the most successful beast in my life independent from ping pong; I am releasing any negative emotions or attachments that kept me thinking I wasn’t good at ping von; I’m releasing any negative emotions or attachments that kept me thinking I needed ping pong in my life to be happy); I want ten detail oriented affirmations; now I want us to get into the specifics of the subject using the exact same things but instead of using the word ping pong were going to use multiple aspects of the area; for example I could use the exact same prompts but instead of saying ping pong I would say arm swing or I would say catching the ball for example I could use the exact same prompts but instead of saying ping pong I would say arm swing or I would say catching the ball; for example we could have two affirmations (successfully winning in catching the ball is a normal experience for me; I am someone who naturally excels at catching the ball above everyone else) for the normal experience section; for example we could have two affirmations (everything comes together in my mind to make the exact correct decisions when catching the ball with no stress; I always have the right instincts when catching the ball; etc) for the automatic decision guiding section; for example we could have two affirmations (I am always easily relaxed and secure with my performance in catching the ball; my nervous system is developing completely normal responses within the experience of catching the ball) for the easily relax and innerly secure section; for example we could have two affirmations (no one better than me at catching the ball; succeeding in catching the ball is a part of my performance I feel proud of) for the identifying as the best in the area section; for example we could have two affirmations (I am releasing any negative emotions or attachments that kept me thinking I wasn’t good at catching the ball; I am no longer worried about success in catching the ball because I know I’m good enough) for the dropping negative attachment section. Ensure that there are 46 affirmations generated at the end (to yourself silently), and if there is not enough then generate more,by away I only want you to use a sentence format from the one I gave you don't make up formats of your own.b.binI have some additional formats for you along with the vast amount I already gave you,but these ones I want you to use in every single affirmation tape no matter what.1it you are always secure with the fact that ping pong is always taken care of for you no matterwhat3you always you are always securely knowing you are going to be successful in ping pong4you are distancing yourself from any fearsthat prevented you from seeingyou were always going to be successful in pin pan5you are always believing positive results are attracted to you naturally in king pong without any manipulation from you.dos are absolutely necessarys   formats otherwise they just want you to take the formats from the ones previously given. i need 46 total.'''},
